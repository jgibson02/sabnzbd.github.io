title: Unix Permissions
---
<p><em>Linux, Unix, macOS only</em></p>
<p>When SABnzbd runs on a Unix-like server, the download result must often be made available for other users.<br>
    Normally files that are created by a user account are private. This is also true for the files created by SABnzbd.<br>
    This is OK for the internal administration files, but not always for the downloaded files.
</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/configuration/{{ site.wiki_version }}/folders">Config-&gt;Folders</a> you can specify which access rights SABnzbd should give the end result.<br>
    This parameter is passed to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod" target="_blank">chmod</a> command. It uses the octal notation supported by <code>chmod</code>.<br>
    You need to specify the settings for <em>folders</em>, so with the X bits set, SABnzbd will automatically remove any X bits for all files.
</p>
Typical values:<br>
<table class="table table-bordered table-hover table-not-fixed">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>0777</code></td>
            <td>full access for everyone</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>0700</code></td>
            <td>only private access</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>0755</code></td>
            <td>private read/write access, others only read access</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>0750</code></td>
            <td>private read/write access, group read access, others no access</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>You can set the permissions in <a href="/wiki/configuration/{{ site.wiki_version }}/folders">Config-&gt;Folders</a>.</p>
